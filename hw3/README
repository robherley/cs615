- installing traceroute and tcpdump with yum
- not knowing how omnios to use snoop (read man page)
  - already had snoop and traceroute installed
  - snoop has an option to listen to packets on /dev/audio 
  - turns out snoop has pratically the same expression syntax as tcpdump
  - use -o to write to file, -i to read
  - use -r to prevent IP address to symbolic name
- traceroute on fedora was significantly faster than omnios (and macos)
- fedora's default traceroute packet size was 60 bytes, omnios was 40 bytes
- had no clue what in-addr.arpa was, but after a quick google, i discovered
it for IPv4 reverse dns lookup, and the address is prepended in reverse, from 
least significant octet to most significant

traceroute

fedora$ sudo tcpdump -w traceroute.dump 'icmp or udp' >&/dev/null &
fedora$ traceroute www.stevens.edu > trace.txt
fedora$ fg

fedora$ sudo tcpdump -n -r traceroute.dump

snoop
=====
omni$ snoop -r -o traceroute.snoop 'udp or icmp' >&/dev/null &
omni$ traceroute www.stevens.edu > trace.txt
omni$ fg
