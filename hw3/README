- installing traceroute and tcpdump with yum
- not knowing how omnios to use snoop (read man page)
  - already had snoop and traceroute installed
  - snoop has an option to listen to packets on /dev/audio 
  - turns out snoop has pratically the same expression syntax as tcpdump
  - use -o to write to file, -i to read
  - use -r to prevent IP address to symbolic name
- traceroute on fedora was significantly faster than omnios (and macos)
- fedora's default traceroute packet size was 60 bytes, omnios was 40 bytes
- had no clue what in-addr.arpa was, but after a quick google, i discovered
it for IPv4 reverse dns lookup, and the address is prepended in reverse, from 
least significant octet to most significant
- made a func:
`function find_hop() { cat traceroute.txt | grep $1 | awk '{ print $1 }' }`
- after looking through the lines of tcpdump, I decided to make a crude
node.js script that will read through the lines and get the output 
that I wanted


# TODO - ask slack
- DNS showing up in snoop?
- does jan want the traceroute


traceroute
==========
fedora$ sudo tcpdump -w traceroute.dump 'icmp or udp' >&/dev/null &
fedora$ traceroute www.stevens.edu > trace.txt
fedora$ fg 
^C
fedora$ sudo tcpdump -n -r traceroute.dump

snoop
=====
omni$ snoop -o traceroute.snoop 'udp or icmp' >&/dev/null &
omni$ traceroute www.stevens.edu > trace.txt
omni$ fg
^C
omni$ snoop -r -i traceroute.snoop
