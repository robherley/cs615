HW3 - Packet Captures

Capturing traceroute Packets
============================
I started with Fedora and tcpdump(8), which I figured would be much easier to 
start with, compared to OmniOS and snoop(1M), which I've never used before. 
After installing tcpdump and traceroute with yum, I ran the following commands 
to collect UDP and ICMP traceroute packets:

  tcpdump
  -------
  fedora$ sudo tcpdump -w traceroute.dump 'icmp or udp' >&/dev/null &
  fedora$ traceroute www.stevens.edu > trace.txt
  fedora$ fg 
  ^C
  fedora$ sudo tcpdump -n -r traceroute.dump

This went fairly well, the man page for tcpdump was useful for finding out the
filters, and discovering that `-n` prevents host addresses to names, which made
it easier to look at the IPs rather than hostnames. After I inspected the
tcpdump, I was able to make a very crude Node.js script to speed up my parsing
and annotating of the traffic. I noticed for the 16th Hop, the ICMP response
had a "host 155.246.21.100 unreachable" message, which I assume was some sort of
firewall used by Stevens (which is probably CloudFlare).

Using snoop and OmniOS was slightly more challenging, as the online support and
documentation for snoop(1M) was not as prominent as tcpdump(8). Also, I've never
used a OpenSolaris-based distribution before. Luckily, traceroute(1M) was
already installed. While inspecting the man pages for snoop(1M), I noticed there
was an option to listen to packets on /dev/audio, which I thought was extremely
interesting. Also, snoop(1M) had a similar filtering syntax to tcpdump(8),
which was quite convenient. I collected the traceroute packets with the
following commands:

  snoop
  -----
  omni$ snoop -o traceroute.snoop 'udp or icmp' >&/dev/null &
  omni$ traceroute www.stevens.edu > trace.txt
  omni$ fg
  ^C
  omni$ snoop -r -i traceroute.snoop

In snoop(1M), `-r` is used to prevent the IP address translation to symbolic
names. The snoop(1M) output was quite different from tcpdump(8), but it was
easily understandable. Again, I made a simple Node.js script to assist with the
annotation of the snoop output.

Some notable differences between the two OS was that Fedora's default traceroute
packet size was 60 bytes, whereas OmniOS's was 40 bytes. In addition, Fedora's
traceroute was also much faster (still unsure why this is the case). Also, I
had no clue what `in-addr.arpa` was at first, but after a quick Google, I
discovered it is for IPv4 reverse DNS lookup, and the address is prepended in
reverse, from least significant octet to most significant. I was also curious
why traceroute had different IPs for the same hop, but I figured it was due to
load balancing. And, the final hop lead to an IP address managed by CloudFlare,
and stopped there, which is probably for protection of Stevens' servers.

Capturing telnet Packets
========================

The first annoyance I noticed was that after I recorded the first tcpdump for
TCP on the fedora instance, it was filled with the SSH traffic from my physical
machine, so I had to go back and filter out that traffic. 

  fedora$ sudo tcpdump -w telnet.pcap 'tcp and not port 22' >&/dev/null &
  fedora$ telnet example.com 80
  Trying 93.184.216.34...
  Connected to example.com.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  HEAD / HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Encoding: gzip
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  Cache-Control: max-age=604800
  Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

  Server: ECS (dcb/7F83)
  X-Cache: HIT
  Content-Length: 606

  ^]

  telnet> close
  Connection closed.
  fedora$ fg
  ^C

A lot of the websites I tested with telnet use SSL or some sort of reverse proxy
which resulted in a lot of redirect responses. Luckily, example.com gave a
plain 200 response with HTTP/1.1. After that was recorded, I was able to SFTP
into the instance and copy the PCAP file to my machine and open it in Wireshark.

One quite interesting occurrence was that towards the end of the list of
packets, the EC2 instance sends a SYN to a Digital Ocean server, and then the
server resets the connection. I'm still not sure what the reasoning is behind
that, maybe someone was probing my EC2 instance.


Visual Traceroutes
==================
After running all the traceroutes (both local and using visual traceroute) I
found that there were a lot of commonly traversed paths depending on region.
For instance, Optimum's hosts in Kansas and Bethpage, NY appeared multiple times
in my local traces. For the visual traceroute traces that started in the UK
region, hostnames from UpCloud in the UKm CenturyLink in Finland and Telia in
Switzerland. Those companies that were repeatedly seen in the traces were
probably the tier-1 operators.

Also, a decent number of the connections did not report back when the packet's
TTL reached zero, which means some of the hops didn't have an identifiable
location, which is probably for security reasons.

  AS Counts
  ---------

  24 [AS174]
  20 [AS16889]
  15 [AS6128]
    9 [AS1273]
    8 [AS3356]
    8 [AS2914]
    7 [AS0]
    6 [AS20001]
    3 [AS680]
    2 [AS9885]
    2 [AS9269]
    2 [AS7575]
    2 [AS55410]
    1 [AS9057]
    1 [AS7570]
    1 [AS4637]
    1 [AS45474]
    1 [AS23719]
    1 [AS19037]
    1 [AS10103]

Using a simple bash for loop I got the output of all the traceroutes with '-a'
to get the AS number:

  for host in `cat hosts.txt`; do
    echo "starting traceroute for $host"
    traceroute -m 30 -a $host 2>/dev/null > trace-$host.txt &
  done

Once they were finished, I was able to count all the seen AS numbers:

  cat trace-* | grep -E -o '\[AS[0-9]+\]' | sort | uniq -c 
    | sort -nr > as_counts.txt

Using the ASN Lookup Tool (https://www.ultratools.com/tools/asnInfo), I saw that
the more common ASes seen in the traces were Cogent Communications (AS174),
Stevens (AS16889 because this was our origin), and Cablevision/Optimum (AS6128).
Interestingly, AS0 appeared a few times, which belonged to
451be09e.cst.lightpath.net (65.19.113.158), and according to ARIN is owned by
Altice/Optimum/Cablevision. I am not sure why the AS number is showing zero
though.
